<p><center> When I was around 10 years old my dad surprised me with a cat when I got home from school. I was afraid of cats up to that point because of bad experiences in the past. But he has been a great cat to have and I've never been happier with a pet. </center></p>
<p><center> My cats name is Micester and he is a white with two black spots on his head. He is 9 years old and my cousin gave me him. He is an outdoor cat and he goes out pretty much every day. He loves to get pet by humans and never claws or bites. Back home he would go up to random people on my street and look at them like he wanted to get pet.</center></p>
<p><center> His favorite foods to eat are chicken and steak. Because I canâ€™t give him that every night I give him wet food with the chicken and steak flavors and Iams dry food.</center></p>
