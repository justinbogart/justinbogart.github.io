<h2><center>About Me</center></h2>

<p><center>My name is Justin Bogart and I'm a Freshman at the University of Maine in Orono, ME. I am pursuing a career in business like some of my other family members including my parents and sister. I'm 18 years old and I come from a small town in Massachusetts called Topsfield. I spent my entire childhood years in this town and have met a lot friends that I still talk to today. I went to Masconomet Regional High School for all fours years of high school and played both football and basketball.</center></p>

I have four siblings (3 sisters and a brother) who are all older. My oldest sister, Kristin, is 29 years old and works as an accountant in Boston. She has been married for one year. My other sister, Vanessa, is also married and works as a nurse. My third sister, Steffi, works as a shoe designer and constantly has to travel to China for work.

<h2><center> UMaine Life </center></h2>
<p><center>Here at the University of Maine I live on campus in York Hall. Normally, I like to go to the gym and play pick-up games of basketball with my friends and usually a bunch of random people. Sometimes after we'll go and lift a little bit. Other things I like to do is play video games because its fun and relaxing for me. Most of the games I play would include Madden, Call of Duty and Fotnite (shocker). </center></p>
